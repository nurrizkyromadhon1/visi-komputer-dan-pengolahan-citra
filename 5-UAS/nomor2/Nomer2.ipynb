Frequency and orientation representations of the Gabor filter are similar to those of the human visual system.\n","\n","The images are filtered using the real parts of various different Gabor filter kernels. The mean and variance of the filtered images are then used as features for classification, which is based on the least squared error for simplicity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Build image pyramids\n","The pyramid_gaussian function takes an image and yields successive images shrunk by a constant scale factor. Image pyramids are often used, e.g., to implement algorithms for denoising, texture discrimination, and scale-invariant detection.\n","\n","Generate a composite image for visualization\n","For visualization, we generate a composite image with the same number of rows as the source image but with cols + pyramid[1].shape[1] columns. We then have space to stack all of the dowsampled images to the right of the original.\n","\n","Note: The sum of the number of rows in all dowsampled images in the pyramid may sometimes exceed the original image size in cases when image.shape[0] is not a power of two. We expand the number of rows in the composite slightly as necessary to account for this. Expansion beyond the number of rows in the original will also be necessary to cover cases where downscale < 2."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMpmh1RTSP/ykBjlDT7bXpV","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
